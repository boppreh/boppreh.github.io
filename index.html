				<h1>Background Applications</h1>

				<p>I love the idea of small programs with little to no interface doing work in the background, and this is my collection of them. These applications live in the tray bar, interfacing with the user through notifications or web services. They are very small, from a few dozen lines to no more than a couple hundred.</p>

				<p>All of them require and make use of the <a href="https://github.com/boppreh/background">background</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boppreh/simpleserver">simpleserver</a> libraries, and are written for Python 3.3. May contain hardcoded paths because they are too small to have proper configurations.</p>
